I have been using it since almost a month. I bought it directly from apple store. And truly i would say, its an amazing device. My reviews are below.1. Great display, its has more color gamut than its previous versions.2. Great stereo speakers, as it has 2 speakers one at the head another at the bottom.3. The antenna band is only 5% visible in bare eyes, until & unless you minutely see it. So the design at the back side looks really clean and sturdy.4. Home button is no longer a physical button now, so it gives you haptik feedback whenever you give an amount of pressure to it. So the amount of pressure you apply decides what function it would invoke.5. The iSight camera now has OIS. So no flickering even if you are shooting while running.6. The touchID is much more faster than 6s. takes a bare minimum of 9-10s to create a touchID.7. A full charge of battery on heavy usage lasts a day. But if you are a moderate user it can last even more. And surprisingly it takes only 2 hours to charge it 100%.8. The Matte finishing on the back side is much more smoother and silkier than 6s. And believe me just go for Matte black if you are planning to buy it. The jet black version is a heck of fingerprint magnet, it takes a scratch even if your nails touches the back side. If you are going for a jet black version please buy a leather back cover before you open the plastic seal of the phone.9. Apple says the phone is splash resistant, but i have seen many of the vlogs the phone is actually water resistant upto 1 metre.10. The conversion of 3.5mm jack to reversible connector has improved the music quality even more.One important thing i would say to every apple user, please buy apple products directly from apple authorized sellers or re-sellers. You can buy it from Reliance Digital, E-Zone, Apple store. Don't buy apple products from online portals, as none of them are authorized by Apple. So if anything gets damaged to your apple device Apple service center doesn't accept the product. And this has happened with many a people.22 Comments|"

But I had a pretty terrible delivery experience.The product was supposed to have arrived within two-days. What else do I pay those extra 100 Rupees for? But it was late and their &quot;Track Package&quot; feature is not updated as often as it should be. The information it gives is also quite vague (perhaps intentionally).When the package did arrive finally a day after the promised date, I was made to walk about 2km from my delivery address because the guy who is delivering did not want to take a U-Turn. He did provide me the attractive option of having it delivered at my doorstep, albeit one more day later. His exact words were - &quot;Come here to pick it up, or wait another day&quot;.I hope this was just an aberration to Amazon's delivery experience and not what is to be expected from now.33 Comments|"

This is an honest review by an Apple Fan :-(i) It's really very beautiful in the Gold colour.(ii) It's processing speed is very faster, even faster than my laptop which has 4 GB ram and Intel i3. The games feel superb, no lagging at all. Even high-end apps are a pleasure to use.(iii) The display at first may feel the same, but it has improved tremendously. It is very rich in colours and one of the finest mobile displays.(iv) It has not lagged or hanged till now even once.(v) Music system definitely feels better, but I hope it was a bit more louder so that there would be no use of wireless speakers.(vi) It'll come preinstalled with iOS 10, which is the best and most friendly OS. It's also virus proof.(vii) The home button is no more clickable. Instead, it will give you a haptic feedback which will give you the feeling of clicking of home button. Of course, the home button has Touch ID sensor which is very fast.(viii) Finally, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus both are dust and splash resistant. But I advice you to not use your iPhone in water.(ix) Yeah, You can STILL USE YOUR CURRENT HEADPHONES. The lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter is included in the pack which will let you connect your current headphone/earphone/EarPods to it.(x) Safari is the ultimate super fast browser.(xi) Force-Touch technology is an interesting technology found only in iPhones and Apple MacBooks and Apple Watches. It is a completely new and loving way to make your work easy and interesting.(xii) Siri is there right inside your iPhone to help you in many ways.(xix) Of course, how can we forget the camera. Forget any other camera. After getting this iPhone 7, you don't need any more camera. The camera is ultimate and better than every other camera.Final Summary :-I don't recommend this iPhone upgrade to iPhone 6S users. Definitely, the price of iPhone 7 is right because QUALITY TECHNOLOGY REQUIRES MONEY. Please forget all other biased and bad comments for iPhone 7. Believe me, it'll blow up every other smartphone by all features. Anyhow, the iPhone 7 is the ultimate phone. You MUST buy a hard case and a tempered glass for any smartphone of yours. I wish you all the best for your purchase. Thank You.0Comment|"

It is a completely new and loving way to make your work easy and interesting.(xii) Siri is there right inside your iPhone to help you in many ways.(xix) Of course, how can we forget the camera. Forget any other camera. After getting this iPhone 7, you don't need any more camera. The camera is ultimate and better than every other camera.Final Summary :-I don't recommend this iPhone upgrade to iPhone 6S users. Definitely, the price of iPhone 7 is right because QUALITY TECHNOLOGY REQUIRES MONEY. Please forget all other biased and bad comments for iPhone 7. Believe me, it'll blow up every other smartphone by all features. Anyhow, the iPhone 7 is the ultimate phone. You MUST buy a hard case and a tempered glass for any smartphone of yours. I wish you all the best for your purchase. Thank You.0Comment|"

I have been using it since almost a month. I bought it directly from apple store. And truly i would say, its an amazing device. My reviews are below.1. Great display, its has more color gamut than its previous versions.2. Great stereo speakers, as it has 2 speakers one at the head another at the bottom.3. The antenna band is only 5% visible in bare eyes, until & unless you minutely see it. So the design at the back side looks really clean and sturdy.4. Home button is no longer a physical button now, so it gives you haptik feedback whenever you give an amount of pressure to it. So the amount of pressure you apply decides what function it would invoke.5. The iSight camera now has OIS. So no flickering even if you are shooting while running.6. The touchID is much more faster than 6s. takes a bare minimum of 9-10s to create a touchID.7. A full charge of battery on heavy usage lasts a day. But if you are a moderate user it can last even more. And surprisingly it takes only 2 hours to charge it 100%.8. The Matte finishing on the back side is much more smoother and silkier than 6s. And believe me just go for Matte black if you are planning to buy it. The jet black version is a heck of fingerprint magnet, it takes a scratch even if your nails touches the back side. If you are going for a jet black version please buy a leather back cover before you open the plastic seal of the phone.9. Apple says the phone is splash resistant, but i have seen many of the vlogs the phone is actually water resistant upto 1 metre.10. The conversion of 3.5mm jack to reversible connector has improved the music quality even more.One important thing i would say to every apple user, please buy apple products directly from apple authorized sellers or re-sellers. You can buy it from Reliance Digital, E-Zone, Apple store. Don't buy apple products from online portals, as none of them are authorized by Apple. So if anything gets damaged to your apple device Apple service center doesn't accept the product. And this has happened with many a people.22 Comments|"

But I had a pretty terrible delivery experience.The product was supposed to have arrived within two-days. What else do I pay those extra 100 Rupees for? But it was late and their &quot;Track Package&quot; feature is not updated as often as it should be. The information it gives is also quite vague (perhaps intentionally).When the package did arrive finally a day after the promised date, I was made to walk about 2km from my delivery address because the guy who is delivering did not want to take a U-Turn. He did provide me the attractive option of having it delivered at my doorstep, albeit one more day later. His exact words were - &quot;Come here to pick it up, or wait another day&quot;.I hope this was just an aberration to Amazon's delivery experience and not what is to be expected from now.33 Comments|"

It's also virus proof.(vii) The home button is no more clickable. Instead, it will give you a haptic feedback which will give you the feeling of clicking of home button.

This is an honest review by an Apple Fan :-(i) It's really very beautiful in the Gold colour.(ii) It's processing speed is very faster, even faster than my laptop which has 4 GB ram and Intel i3. The games feel superb, no lagging at all. Even high-end apps are a pleasure to use.(iii) The display at first may feel the same, but it has improved tremendously. It is very rich in colours and one of the finest mobile displays.(iv) It has not lagged or hanged till now even once.(v) Music system definitely feels better, but I hope it was a bit more louder so that there would be no use of wireless speakers.(vi) It'll come preinstalled with iOS 10, which is the best and most friendly OS. It's also virus proof.(vii) The home button is no more clickable. Instead, it will give you a haptic feedback which will give you the feeling of clicking of home button. Of course, the home button has Touch ID sensor which is very fast.(viii) Finally, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus both are dust and splash resistant. But I advice you to not use your iPhone in water.(ix) Yeah, You can STILL USE YOUR CURRENT HEADPHONES. The lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter is included in the pack which will let you connect your current headphone/earphone/EarPods to it.(x) Safari is the ultimate super fast browser.(xi) Force-Touch technology is an interesting technology found only in iPhones and Apple MacBooks and Apple Watches. It is a completely new and loving way to make your work easy and interesting.(xii) Siri is there right inside your iPhone to help you in many ways.(xix) Of course, how can we forget the camera. Forget any other camera. After getting this iPhone 7, you don't need any more camera. The camera is ultimate and better than every other camera.Final Summary :-I don't recommend this iPhone upgrade to iPhone 6S users. Definitely, the price of iPhone 7 is right because QUALITY TECHNOLOGY REQUIRES MONEY. Please forget all other biased and bad comments for iPhone 7. Believe me, it'll blow up every other smartphone by all features. Anyhow, the iPhone 7 is the ultimate phone. You MUST buy a hard case and a tempered glass for any smartphone of yours. I wish you all the best for your purchase. Thank You.0Comment|"

I have been using it since almost a month. I bought it directly from apple store. And truly i would say, its an amazing device. My reviews are below.1. Great display, its has more color gamut than its previous versions.2. Great stereo speakers, as it has 2 speakers one at the head another at the bottom.3. The antenna band is only 5% visible in bare eyes, until & unless you minutely see it. So the design at the back side looks really clean and sturdy.4. Home button is no longer a physical button now, so it gives you haptik feedback whenever you give an amount of pressure to it. So the amount of pressure you apply decides what function it would invoke.5. The iSight camera now has OIS. So no flickering even if you are shooting while running.6. The touchID is much more faster than 6s. takes a bare minimum of 9-10s to create a touchID.7. A full charge of battery on heavy usage lasts a day. But if you are a moderate user it can last even more. And surprisingly it takes only 2 hours to charge it 100%.8. The Matte finishing on the back side is much more smoother and silkier than 6s. And believe me just go for Matte black if you are planning to buy it. The jet black version is a heck of fingerprint magnet, it takes a scratch even if your nails touches the back side. If you are going for a jet black version please buy a leather back cover before you open the plastic seal of the phone.9. Apple says the phone is splash resistant, but i have seen many of the vlogs the phone is actually water resistant upto 1 metre.10. The conversion of 3.5mm jack to reversible connector has improved the music quality even more.One important thing i would say to every apple user, please buy apple products directly from apple authorized sellers or re-sellers. You can buy it from Reliance Digital, E-Zone, Apple store. Don't buy apple products from online portals, as none of them are authorized by Apple. So if anything gets damaged to your apple device Apple service center doesn't accept the product. And this has happened with many a people.22 Comments|"

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsGreat product - But terrible delivery experienceBycafesoloon 22 October 2016Colour: Jet Black|Size: 128 GB|Verified PurchaseThere's not much left to say about the iPhone 7 and I'm incredibly delighted to have bought one. But I had a pretty terrible delivery experience.The product was supposed to have arrived within two-days. What else do I pay those extra 100 Rupees for? But it was late and their &quot;Track Package&quot; feature is not updated as often as it should be. The information it gives is also quite vague (perhaps intentionally).When the package did arrive finally a day after the promised date, I was made to walk about 2km from my delivery address because the guy who is delivering did not want to take a U-Turn. He did provide me the attractive option of having it delivered at my doorstep, albeit one more day later. His exact words were - &quot;Come here to pick it up, or wait another day&quot;.I hope this was just an aberration to Amazon's delivery experience and not what is to be expected from now.33 Comments|"

This is an honest review by an Apple Fan :-(i) It's really very beautiful in the Gold colour.(ii) It's processing speed is very faster, even faster than my laptop which has 4 GB ram and Intel i3. The games feel superb, no lagging at all. Even high-end apps are a pleasure to use.(iii) The display at first may feel the same, but it has improved tremendously. It is very rich in colours and one of the finest mobile displays.(iv) It has not lagged or hanged till now even once.(v) Music system definitely feels better, but I hope it was a bit more louder so that there would be no use of wireless speakers.(vi) It'll come preinstalled with iOS 10, which is the best and most friendly OS. It's also virus proof.(vii) The home button is no more clickable. Instead, it will give you a haptic feedback which will give you the feeling of clicking of home button. Of course, the home button has Touch ID sensor which is very fast.(viii) Finally, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus both are dust and splash resistant. But I advice you to not use your iPhone in water.(ix) Yeah, You can STILL USE YOUR CURRENT HEADPHONES. The lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter is included in the pack which will let you connect your current headphone/earphone/EarPods to it.(x) Safari is the ultimate super fast browser.(xi) Force-Touch technology is an interesting technology found only in iPhones and Apple MacBooks and Apple Watches. It is a completely new and loving way to make your work easy and interesting.(xii) Siri is there right inside your iPhone to help you in many ways.(xix) Of course, how can we forget the camera. Forget any other camera. After getting this iPhone 7, you don't need any more camera. The camera is ultimate and better than every other camera.Final Summary :-I don't recommend this iPhone upgrade to iPhone 6S users. Definitely, the price of iPhone 7 is right because QUALITY TECHNOLOGY REQUIRES MONEY. Please forget all other biased and bad comments for iPhone 7. Believe me, it'll blow up every other smartphone by all features. Anyhow, the iPhone 7 is the ultimate phone. You MUST buy a hard case and a tempered glass for any smartphone of yours. I wish you all the best for your purchase. Thank You.0Comment|"

I have been using it since almost a month. I bought it directly from apple store. And truly i would say, its an amazing device. My reviews are below.1. Great display, its has more color gamut than its previous versions.2. Great stereo speakers, as it has 2 speakers one at the head another at the bottom.3. The antenna band is only 5% visible in bare eyes, until & unless you minutely see it. So the design at the back side looks really clean and sturdy.4. Home button is no longer a physical button now, so it gives you haptik feedback whenever you give an amount of pressure to it. So the amount of pressure you apply decides what function it would invoke.5. The iSight camera now has OIS. So no flickering even if you are shooting while running.6. The touchID is much more faster than 6s. takes a bare minimum of 9-10s to create a touchID.7. A full charge of battery on heavy usage lasts a day. But if you are a moderate user it can last even more. And surprisingly it takes only 2 hours to charge it 100%.8. The Matte finishing on the back side is much more smoother and silkier than 6s. And believe me just go for Matte black if you are planning to buy it. The jet black version is a heck of fingerprint magnet, it takes a scratch even if your nails touches the back side. If you are going for a jet black version please buy a leather back cover before you open the plastic seal of the phone.9. Apple says the phone is splash resistant, but i have seen many of the vlogs the phone is actually water resistant upto 1 metre.10. The conversion of 3.5mm jack to reversible connector has improved the music quality even more.One important thing i would say to every apple user, please buy apple products directly from apple authorized sellers or re-sellers. You can buy it from Reliance Digital, E-Zone, Apple store. Don't buy apple products from online portals, as none of them are authorized by Apple. So if anything gets damaged to your apple device Apple service center doesn't accept the product. And this has happened with many a people.22 Comments|"
